# Rubik_s_Cube
This Rubik's Cube game is developed in C++ using OpenGL for real-time 3D graphics rendering. The application provides an interactive and visually accurate 3D Rubik's Cube that users can rotate, scramble, and attempt to solve using keyboard or mouse inputs.
# 3D Rubik's Cube Simulator

This project is a 3D Rubikâ€™s Cube simulator built with **C++**, **OpenGL**, and **GLUT**. It visually simulates a Rubikâ€™s cube, allowing users to rotate the view and twist cube faces using keyboard input. The cube is rendered in real-time with lighting and material effects.
